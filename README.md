# Forest RTS

The official repository for the Dota 2 custom game mode Forest RTS. This is still a work-in-progress project.
This game mode should be played with players on both teams, even though single player and Co-Op is possible.

### Modes:
There are currently two ways this game mode can be played:
* Single player / Co-Op: Works for trying out the mod, but it isn't very exiting. The player(s) can fight wandering patrols of enemy units. These patrols will be replaced by bots when they're finished (under construction).
* PvP: Played with players on both teams, this is how the game mode is supposed to be played. Build a base, train an army and defeat the enemy player(s).

Special thanks goes to the creators of all the libraries used.
